"""Norm discovery in the BOE catalog.

The BOE API does not expose a directly filterable catalog endpoint.
For bootstrap, we use two strategies:
1. Fixed norms list (fixed_norms in config): always processed
2. Summary sweep: iterate summaries by date to discover new norms

For Phase 2, the bootstrap works primarily with fixed_norms.
Automatic discovery via summaries is used in the daily flow.
